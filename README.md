direct optimal mapping on ra/dec grid

This repository stores the mapping scripts to generate maps in ra/dec grid from different datasets.
Currently, we have the scripts focused on mapping:
- Honggeun's simulation
- HERA Phase I validation data, https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera-validation
- HERA H1C data
